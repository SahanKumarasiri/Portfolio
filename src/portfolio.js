The term ‚Äòasynchronous,‚Äô often known as ‚Äòasync,‚Äô simply means ‚Äòtakes some time‚Äô or ‚Äòhappens later, not immediately.‚Äô Callbacks are typically used solely when doing I/O, such as downloading files, reading files, interacting to databases, and so on."

        "Koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs. By leveraging async functions, Koa allows you to ditch callbacks and greatly increase error-handling. Koa does not bundle any middleware within its core, and it provides an elegant suite of methods that make writing servers fast and enjoyable."
